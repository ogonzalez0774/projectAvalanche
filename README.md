## User Story

Sometimes I just want some poetry to read that reflects the weather and the world outside. I also tend to have trouble finding poems myself, as there are numerous poems of which I haven't ever even heard.

## Problem We're Solving

Selecting poetry based on the weather at user's location.

## Goals
